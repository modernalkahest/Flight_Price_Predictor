# Flight_Price_Predictor
* A simple Linear regression algorithm that determines the price of a flight given a few factors:
    * The Airline brand
    * The number of stops for the flight
    * the fuel capacity of the flight
    * Departure and Arrival Time
    * Journey Time
    * Distance between each stop
 
## Model Used
* A simple Linear regression model with a few encoding techniques for the categorical data.
* The model is fine tuned using a GridSearchCV algorithm
